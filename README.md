# 📝 Data Science Learning Project: Rugby Union Internationals (1871 - 2024)

## 📖 About This Project

This is an **ongoing project** that is part of my learning journey in Python for Data Science, which I recently completed on Codecademy.

Right now, I’m focusing on:

 - **Importing** and **modifying** CSV files 📂
 - **Cleaning** and **analysing** data using pandas and NumPy 🧼🔍

Later, I’ll add data visualisations using Seaborn and Matplotlib after completing the Data Visualisation 📊 course on Codecademy.

## 🎯 Possible project questions
1. Which team has won the most matches since records began? Does the same team have the highest win rate?
2. Which team(s) have the highest home/away/neutral win rates?
3. Which teams have the highest points differential across time?
4. What are the average number of points scores per game for each stadium?
5. How do different teams' win rates change over time and which is the most improved team?

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Install Required Packages** 

You need Python and the following libraries:

```bash
  pip install pandas NumPy jupyter matplotlib seaborn
```
### **2️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook**

Open the notebooks/ folder and start exploring the data!

## 🛠 Features I am currently working on...

- Load and clean CSV files with pandas
- Basic data analysis (mean, median, missing values, etc.)
- Filtering and modifying datasets

## 🔜 Coming Soon:

- Data visualisations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Insights from real-world datasets
