# 📝 My Data Science Learning Project

## 📖 About This Project
This is an **ongoing project** that is part of my learning journey in **Python for Data Science**, which I recently completed on **Codecademy**. 

Right now, I’m focusing on:
- Importing and modifying CSV files 📂
- Cleaning and analyzing data using **pandas** 🧼🔍

Later, I’ll add **data visualisations** using **Seaborn and Matplotlib** after completing the **Data Visualization** course on Codecademy. 📊

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Install Required Packages**
You need **Python** and the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas jupyter matplotlib seaborn

🤝 Contributing
This project is just for my learning, but if you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue!

2️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook
Run this command inside the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Then open the notebooks/ folder and start exploring the data!


🛠 Features (So Far)
✔ Load and clean CSV files with pandas
✔ Basic data analysis (mean, median, missing values, etc.)
✔ Filtering and modifying datasets

🔜 Coming Soon:
🔹 Data visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
🔹 Insights from real-world datasets
