# 📝 Data Science Learning Project: Rugby Union Internationals (1871 - 2024)

## 📖 About This Project

This is an **ongoing project** that is part of my learning journey in Python for Data Science, which I recently completed on Codecademy.

Right now, I’m focusing on:

 - Importing and modifying CSV files 📂
 - Cleaning and analyzing data using pandas 🧼🔍

Later, I’ll add data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib after completing the Data Visualization course on Codecademy. 📊

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Install Required Packages** 

  You need Python and the following libraries:

```bash
  pip install pandas jupyter matplotlib seaborn
```
### **2️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook**

  Open the notebooks/ folder and start exploring the data!

## 🛠 Features I am currently working on...

- Load and clean CSV files with pandas
- Basic data analysis (mean, median, missing values, etc.)
- Filtering and modifying datasets

## 🔜 Coming Soon:

- Data visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Insights from real-world datasets
